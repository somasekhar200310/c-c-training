/*
Base Subobject:
- A base subobject is the portion of a derived class that represents its base class
- When a class inherits from a base class:
    * A base subobject is created within the derived class
    * One subobject per base class
    * Contains inherited attributes and behaviors
    * Enables derived class to access base class members

Example:
class Base {};
class Derived : public Base {}; 
// Derived contains a Base subobject
